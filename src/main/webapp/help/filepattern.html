    Used to determine what files to send to Veracode for scanning.  This is an ant style includes that runs from the
    context of the jobs workspace root directory.  So something like '*.war' for instance would include all war files
    in the builds workspace directory for scanning and '**/*.war' would include all war files in any directory under the
    workspace directory.
